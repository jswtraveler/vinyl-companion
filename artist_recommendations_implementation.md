# Artist Recommendations Implementation Roadmap (Updated with Improvements)

## 1. Core Concept

Implement **“Check These Artists Out”**: surface artists you don’t own, ranked by connection strength to your collection.

**Scoring Formula (with novelty and normalization):**
```
ArtistScore(a_c) = α * log(1 + Σ Conn(a_o, a_c)) / sqrt(|OwnedArtists|)
                 + β * |{a_o : Conn(a_o, a_c) ≥ τ}|
                 + γ * pop(a_c)
                 + δ * novelty(a_c)
```

- **α (0.6)** = total connection strength (normalized for collection size)
- **β (0.3)** = breadth of connections (strong edges count)
- **γ (0.1)** = popularity prior
- **δ (0.05)** = novelty (underrepresented genres, user-tunable slider)
- **τ = 0.5** similarity threshold
- Cap per-owned-artist contribution (top-K similar per artist only).

## 2. ListenBrainz Migration Strategy

### **Why Switch from Last.fm to ListenBrainz**

**Current Pain Points with Last.fm:**
- String-based artist matching causes missed connections
- API key management and rate limiting complexity
- Commercial bias in recommendation algorithms
- Dependency on external service with potential pricing changes

**ListenBrainz Advantages:**
- **Native MusicBrainz ID integration** - perfect synergy with our enhanced matching system
- **Open source and free** - no API keys, rate limits, or vendor lock-in
- **Quality-focused recommendations** - better for curated vinyl collections than streaming-focused data
- **Direct MBID relationships** - enables sophisticated graph algorithms without string matching

### **Migration Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Parallel Implementation (Week 0)** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Implement `ListenBrainzClient` alongside existing `LastFmClient`
- ✅ Add feature flag to switch between services (`useListenBrainz: boolean`)
- ✅ Maintain existing Last.fm workflows as fallback

```javascript
// Enhanced service initialization
const recommendationService = new RecommendationService({
  useListenBrainz: true,          // Feature flag
  listenBrainzFallbackToLastfm: true,  // Graceful degradation
  lastfmApiKey: process.env.VITE_LASTFM_API_KEY  // Keep as backup
});
```

#### **Phase 2: A/B Testing (Week 1)** ⏸️ **DEFERRED**
- ⏭️ Run both services in parallel for recommendation comparison
- ⏭️ Log recommendation quality metrics (coverage, relevance, diversity)
- ⏭️ User preference feedback collection
- ⏭️ Performance benchmarking (API response times, accuracy)

*Note: Focusing on Last.fm + MBID enhancement for MVP. ListenBrainz integration deferred due to CORS limitations.*

#### **Phase 3: Gradual Migration (Week 2)** ⏸️ **DEFERRED**
- ⏭️ Default to ListenBrainz with Last.fm fallback for missing data
- ⏭️ Migrate existing cached data where MBIDs are available
- ⏭️ Update documentation and configuration

#### **Phase 4: Complete Migration (Week 3)** ⏸️ **DEFERRED**
- ⏭️ Remove Last.fm dependencies for new installations
- ⏭️ Keep Last.fm support for legacy data compatibility
- ⏭️ Update API documentation and examples

### **Implementation Strategy**

**ListenBrainz API Endpoints to Implement:**
- **Similar artists**: `/1/explore/similar-artists/{artist_mbid}`
- **Artist statistics**: `/1/stats/artist/{artist_mbid}`
- **Recording lookup**: `/1/explore/recording/{recording_mbid}`
- **User recommendations**: `/1/recommend/recording` (if user listening data available)

**Enhanced Data Pipeline:**
```javascript
// Direct MBID-based queries (no string matching needed)
const similarArtists = await listenBrainzClient.getSimilarArtists(artistMBID);
const artistStats = await listenBrainzClient.getArtistStats(artistMBID);

// Seamless integration with existing MusicBrainz data
const enhancedProfile = {
  ...userProfile,
  artistMBIDs: extractedMBIDs,
  listenBrainzData: similarArtists
};
```

**Benefits for Graph Algorithms:**
- **Direct MBID connections** enable true graph traversal
- **No string normalization overhead**
- **Higher precision artist relationships**
- **Native support for multi-hop discovery**

## 3. Roadmap

### **MVP (Persisted, Normalized, Week 1–2)** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Goals:**
- ✅ Persist Last.fm similarity & metadata globally (not per-user).
- ✅ Use per-user link tables for owned artists and recommendation cache.
- ✅ Compute scores in SQL (joins + aggregations) for speed.
- ✅ Cache recommendation results for 24h (not 6h).
- 🔄 Add diversity control (no >3 recs from same tag/decade). *[Partially implemented]*

**Database schema (minimal, global + user link):**
- ✅ `artist_similarity_cache` (global, 30d TTL)
- ✅ `artist_metadata_cache` (global, 14d TTL for listeners/tags)
- ✅ `user_owned_artists`
- ✅ `user_artist_recs_cache` (24h TTL)

**Service layer:**
- ✅ `RecommendationCacheService` (global fetch/persist) *[Enhanced implementation]*
- ✅ `RecommendationScoring` (with normalization + diversity filter)
- ✅ `RecommendationService` (per-user query + cache)

**UI:**
- ✅ Simple list of artist cards with score, tags, and connected artists.
- ✅ Explicit coverage/confidence indicator if <30% of library collected.

---

### **Intermediate (Graph Algorithms, Progressive Collector, Novelty, Week 3–5)** 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**

**Goals:**
- 📋 **Graph-based recommendation scoring** using random walk with restart algorithm.
- 📋 Progressive collection service to fill gaps daily (server-side cron).
- 📋 Novelty scoring with user-tunable slider (δ factor).
- ✅ Confidence scores based on data coverage & edge diversity.
- ✅ Exponential backoff on API failures.
- ✅ Bulk upserts for efficiency.

**Enhanced Scoring Formula (with graph algorithms):**
```
ArtistScore(a_c) = α * GraphWalkScore(a_c, UserArtists) / sqrt(|OwnedArtists|)
                 + β * |{a_o : Conn(a_o, a_c) ≥ τ}|
                 + γ * pop(a_c)
                 + δ * novelty(a_c)

where GraphWalkScore = Σ (restart_prob^depth * path_similarity)
```

**Database schema (extended with graph support):**
- 📋 `collection_progress` (status, attempts, priority, staleness decay)
- 📋 `collection_stats` (daily API usage, error counts)
- 📋 `artist_similarity_graph` (materialized view for fast graph queries)
- ✅ Extend `user_artist_recs_cache` with explanation + confidence + graph_paths.

**Graph Algorithm Implementation:**

```sql
-- PostgreSQL recursive CTE for random walk scoring
WITH RECURSIVE artist_walk AS (
  -- Base case: user's owned artists (restart points)
  SELECT
    s.target_artist,
    s.similarity_score * 0.85 as walk_score,  -- restart probability
    1 as depth,
    u.artist_id as origin_artist
  FROM user_owned_artists u
  JOIN artist_similarity_cache s ON u.artist_id = s.source_artist
  WHERE s.similarity_score >= 0.3  -- minimum edge weight

  UNION ALL

  -- Recursive case: continue walk through similarity graph
  SELECT
    s.target_artist,
    w.walk_score * s.similarity_score * 0.85^w.depth as walk_score,
    w.depth + 1,
    w.origin_artist
  FROM artist_walk w
  JOIN artist_similarity_cache s ON w.target_artist = s.source_artist
  WHERE w.depth < 3  -- limit walk depth for performance
    AND s.similarity_score >= 0.3
)
SELECT
  target_artist,
  SUM(walk_score) as graph_score,
  COUNT(DISTINCT origin_artist) as connection_breadth,
  ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT origin_artist) as connected_to
FROM artist_walk
WHERE target_artist NOT IN (SELECT artist_id FROM user_owned_artists)
GROUP BY target_artist
ORDER BY graph_score DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Services:**
- 📋 `GraphRecommendationEngine` (PostgreSQL graph traversal + scoring)
- 📋 `ProgressiveDataCollector` (server-side scheduling, budget-aware)
- 📋 `BudgetManager` (daily/hourly API limits)
- 📋 `SimilarityGraphBuilder` (builds coverage map + materialized views)
- 📋 `GraphPathExplainer` (generates "because you own X→Y→Z" explanations)

**Frontend Graph Processing (fallback/enhancement):**
```javascript
// Optional: client-side graph algorithms for real-time tuning
import { Graph } from 'graphology';
import { randomWalkScoring } from 'graphology-algorithms';

const enhanceRecommendations = async (baseRecs, userPreferences) => {
  // Build similarity graph from cached data
  const graph = await buildSimilarityGraph();

  // Apply user-specific graph parameters
  const enhanced = randomWalkScoring(graph, {
    restartProbability: userPreferences.explorationLevel,
    maxDepth: userPreferences.discoveryRange,
    edgeThreshold: userPreferences.similarityThreshold
  });

  return enhanced;
};
```

**UI Enhancements:**
- ✅ Progress indicator (X/Y artists collected, completeness %).
- 📋 **Graph visualization** for recommendation paths (optional, via cytoscape.js).
- 📋 Expandable artist cards with **connection paths**: "Via: Your Artist → Similar Artist → Recommendation".
- 📋 **Discovery controls**: sliders for walk depth, restart probability, edge threshold.
- ✅ Refresh button with retry on failure.
- 📋 Novelty slider in preferences.
