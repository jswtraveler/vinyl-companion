# Artist Recommendations Implementation Roadmap (Updated with Improvements)

## 1. Core Concept

Implement **“Check These Artists Out”**: surface artists you don’t own, ranked by connection strength to your collection.

**Scoring Formula (with novelty and normalization):**
```
ArtistScore(a_c) = α * log(1 + Σ Conn(a_o, a_c)) / sqrt(|OwnedArtists|)
                 + β * |{a_o : Conn(a_o, a_c) ≥ τ}|
                 + γ * pop(a_c)
                 + δ * novelty(a_c)
```

- **α (0.6)** = total connection strength (normalized for collection size)
- **β (0.3)** = breadth of connections (strong edges count)
- **γ (0.1)** = popularity prior
- **δ (0.05)** = novelty (underrepresented genres, user-tunable slider)
- **τ = 0.5** similarity threshold
- Cap per-owned-artist contribution (top-K similar per artist only).

## 2. ListenBrainz Migration Strategy

### **Why Switch from Last.fm to ListenBrainz**

**Current Pain Points with Last.fm:**
- String-based artist matching causes missed connections
- API key management and rate limiting complexity
- Commercial bias in recommendation algorithms
- Dependency on external service with potential pricing changes

**ListenBrainz Advantages:**
- **Native MusicBrainz ID integration** - perfect synergy with our enhanced matching system
- **Open source and free** - no API keys, rate limits, or vendor lock-in
- **Quality-focused recommendations** - better for curated vinyl collections than streaming-focused data
- **Direct MBID relationships** - enables sophisticated graph algorithms without string matching

### **Migration Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Parallel Implementation (Week 0)** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Implement `ListenBrainzClient` alongside existing `LastFmClient`
- ✅ Add feature flag to switch between services (`useListenBrainz: boolean`)
- ✅ Maintain existing Last.fm workflows as fallback

```javascript
// Enhanced service initialization
const recommendationService = new RecommendationService({
  useListenBrainz: true,          // Feature flag
  listenBrainzFallbackToLastfm: true,  // Graceful degradation
  lastfmApiKey: process.env.VITE_LASTFM_API_KEY  // Keep as backup
});
```

#### **Phase 2: A/B Testing (Week 1)** ⏸️ **DEFERRED**
- ⏭️ Run both services in parallel for recommendation comparison
- ⏭️ Log recommendation quality metrics (coverage, relevance, diversity)
- ⏭️ User preference feedback collection
- ⏭️ Performance benchmarking (API response times, accuracy)

*Note: Focusing on Last.fm + MBID enhancement for MVP. ListenBrainz integration deferred due to CORS limitations.*

#### **Phase 3: Gradual Migration (Week 2)** ⏸️ **DEFERRED**
- ⏭️ Default to ListenBrainz with Last.fm fallback for missing data
- ⏭️ Migrate existing cached data where MBIDs are available
- ⏭️ Update documentation and configuration

#### **Phase 4: Complete Migration (Week 3)** ⏸️ **DEFERRED**
- ⏭️ Remove Last.fm dependencies for new installations
- ⏭️ Keep Last.fm support for legacy data compatibility
- ⏭️ Update API documentation and examples

### **Implementation Strategy**

**ListenBrainz API Endpoints to Implement:**
- **Similar artists**: `/1/explore/similar-artists/{artist_mbid}`
- **Artist statistics**: `/1/stats/artist/{artist_mbid}`
- **Recording lookup**: `/1/explore/recording/{recording_mbid}`
- **User recommendations**: `/1/recommend/recording` (if user listening data available)

**Enhanced Data Pipeline:**
```javascript
// Direct MBID-based queries (no string matching needed)
const similarArtists = await listenBrainzClient.getSimilarArtists(artistMBID);
const artistStats = await listenBrainzClient.getArtistStats(artistMBID);

// Seamless integration with existing MusicBrainz data
const enhancedProfile = {
  ...userProfile,
  artistMBIDs: extractedMBIDs,
  listenBrainzData: similarArtists
};
```

**Benefits for Graph Algorithms:**
- **Direct MBID connections** enable true graph traversal
- **No string normalization overhead**
- **Higher precision artist relationships**
- **Native support for multi-hop discovery**

---

## 3. Roadmap

### **MVP (Persisted, Normalized, Week 1–2)** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Goals:**
- ✅ Persist Last.fm similarity & metadata globally (not per-user).
- ✅ Use per-user link tables for owned artists and recommendation cache.
- ✅ Compute scores in SQL (joins + aggregations) for speed.
- ✅ Cache recommendation results for 24h (not 6h).
- 🔄 Add diversity control (no >3 recs from same tag/decade). *[Partially implemented]*

**Database schema (minimal, global + user link):**
- ✅ `artist_similarity_cache` (global, 30d TTL)
- ✅ `artist_metadata_cache` (global, 14d TTL for listeners/tags)
- ✅ `user_owned_artists`
- ✅ `user_artist_recs_cache` (24h TTL)

**Service layer:**
- ✅ `RecommendationCacheService` (global fetch/persist) *[Enhanced implementation]*
- ✅ `RecommendationScoring` (with normalization + diversity filter)
- ✅ `RecommendationService` (per-user query + cache)

**UI:**
- ✅ Simple list of artist cards with score, tags, and connected artists.
- ✅ Explicit coverage/confidence indicator if <30% of library collected.

---

### **Intermediate (Graph Algorithms, Progressive Collector, Novelty, Week 3–5)** ✅ **CORE FEATURES COMPLETED**

**Goals:**
- ✅ **Graph-based recommendation scoring** using random walk with restart algorithm.
- ✅ **Progressive collection service** - client-side idle-time metadata collection with priority queue.
- 📋 Novelty scoring with user-tunable slider (δ factor).
- ✅ Confidence scores based on data coverage & edge diversity.
- ✅ Exponential backoff on API failures.
- ✅ Bulk upserts for efficiency.

**Enhanced Scoring Formula (with graph algorithms):**
```
ArtistScore(a_c) = α * GraphWalkScore(a_c, UserArtists) / sqrt(|OwnedArtists|)
                 + β * |{a_o : Conn(a_o, a_c) ≥ τ}|
                 + γ * pop(a_c)
                 + δ * novelty(a_c)

where GraphWalkScore = Σ (restart_prob^depth * path_similarity)
```

**Database schema (extended with graph support):**
- 📋 `collection_progress` (status, attempts, priority, staleness decay)
- 📋 `collection_stats` (daily API usage, error counts)
- 📋 `artist_similarity_graph` (materialized view for fast graph queries)
- ✅ Extend `user_artist_recs_cache` with explanation + confidence + graph_paths.

**Graph Algorithm Implementation:**

```sql
-- PostgreSQL recursive CTE for random walk scoring
WITH RECURSIVE artist_walk AS (
  -- Base case: user's owned artists (restart points)
  SELECT
    s.target_artist,
    s.similarity_score * 0.85 as walk_score,  -- restart probability
    1 as depth,
    u.artist_id as origin_artist
  FROM user_owned_artists u
  JOIN artist_similarity_cache s ON u.artist_id = s.source_artist
  WHERE s.similarity_score >= 0.3  -- minimum edge weight

  UNION ALL

  -- Recursive case: continue walk through similarity graph
  SELECT
    s.target_artist,
    w.walk_score * s.similarity_score * 0.85^w.depth as walk_score,
    w.depth + 1,
    w.origin_artist
  FROM artist_walk w
  JOIN artist_similarity_cache s ON w.target_artist = s.source_artist
  WHERE w.depth < 3  -- limit walk depth for performance
    AND s.similarity_score >= 0.3
)
SELECT
  target_artist,
  SUM(walk_score) as graph_score,
  COUNT(DISTINCT origin_artist) as connection_breadth,
  ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT origin_artist) as connected_to
FROM artist_walk
WHERE target_artist NOT IN (SELECT artist_id FROM user_owned_artists)
GROUP BY target_artist
ORDER BY graph_score DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Services:**
- ✅ `GraphRecommendationService` (PostgreSQL + JavaScript fallback graph traversal)
- ✅ `ProgressiveCollectionService` (client-side idle detection, priority queue, rate limiting)
- 📋 `BudgetManager` (daily/hourly API limits)
- 📋 `SimilarityGraphBuilder` (builds coverage map + materialized views)
- ✅ `GraphPathExplainer` (implemented as connection explanations in UI)

**Frontend Graph Processing (fallback/enhancement):**
```javascript
// Optional: client-side graph algorithms for real-time tuning
import { Graph } from 'graphology';
import { randomWalkScoring } from 'graphology-algorithms';

const enhanceRecommendations = async (baseRecs, userPreferences) => {
  // Build similarity graph from cached data
  const graph = await buildSimilarityGraph();

  // Apply user-specific graph parameters
  const enhanced = randomWalkScoring(graph, {
    restartProbability: userPreferences.explorationLevel,
    maxDepth: userPreferences.discoveryRange,
    edgeThreshold: userPreferences.similarityThreshold
  });

  return enhanced;
};
```

**UI Enhancements:**
- ✅ **Progressive collection status card**: Real-time progress with manual controls (pause/resume/clear).
- ✅ Progress indicator (X/Y artists collected, completeness %).
- 📋 **Graph visualization** for recommendation paths (optional, via cytoscape.js).
- ✅ **Algorithm toggle**: Switch between Graph 🕸️ and Basic 📊 algorithms.
- ✅ **Connection explanations**: "Connected to X artists in your collection".
- ✅ **Algorithm indicators**: Visual badges showing active recommendation method.
- ✅ **Enhanced metadata display**: Walk depth, seed artists, generation time.
- ✅ Refresh button with retry on failure.
- 📋 Novelty slider in preferences.

## ⚠️ **Known API Limitations**

### **Last.fm API - Artist Images No Longer Available**

**Issue**: As of 2024, the Last.fm API has discontinued providing artist images in their API responses.

**Affected Endpoints**:
- `artist.getsimilar` - No longer includes `image` array in response
- `artist.getinfo` - No longer includes artist profile images
- Any similar artist data fetched from Last.fm

**Impact on Application**:
- Artist recommendation cards display generic placeholder icons instead of artist photos
- No visual differentiation between artists in recommendation lists
- UI component `ArtistRecommendationCard` falls back to SVG icon (person silhouette)

**Code References**:
- src/components/ArtistRecommendationSection.jsx:491 - `image: similarArtist.image` stores image URL (now always empty/undefined)
- src/components/ArtistRecommendationSection.jsx:689-708 - Renders fallback icon when image unavailable

**Workaround Options** (not yet implemented):
1. **MusicBrainz Cover Art Archive**: Use MBID to fetch artist images from Cover Art Archive
2. **Discogs API**: Artist images available (requires separate API key)
3. **Fanart.tv**: Artist images and fanart (requires API key, rate limited)
4. **Spotify Web API**: Artist images available (requires OAuth)
5. **Manual Curation**: Pre-fetch and store popular artist images in database

**Current Behavior**:
- All artist recommendation cards display generic SVG person icon
- Fallback is graceful and doesn't affect functionality
- Users can still identify artists by name and metadata

**Priority**: Low - Visual enhancement only, no functional impact on recommendations

## 🐛 **Current Debug Session (September 2024)**

### **Problem Description**
Artist recommendations showing "No artist recommendations available at this time" on **localhost development environment**, while the **production deployment works correctly** and displays recommendations.

### **Environment-Specific Issue Analysis**

**Why this only occurs in localhost:**

1. **Database State Differences**:
   - **Production**: Contains cached similarity data from previous users and API calls
   - **Localhost**: Empty database with no cached `artist_similarity_cache` or `artist_metadata_cache` entries

2. **PostgreSQL Function Availability**:
   - **Production**: Has `graph_artist_recommendations` PostgreSQL function deployed
   - **Localhost**: Missing the graph recommendation function (returns HTTP 404)

3. **API Call History**:
   - **Production**: Accumulated Last.fm API responses cached over time
   - **Localhost**: No cached responses, must fetch fresh data from Last.fm API

4. **User Data**:
   - **Production**: Multiple users have populated global caches
   - **Localhost**: Single developer with limited cached data

### **Root Cause Identified**

The issue was **not** environment-specific caching differences, but a **code logic error**:

- **Graph Algorithm**: Failing gracefully due to missing PostgreSQL function ✅
- **Basic Algorithm Fallback**: Working correctly ✅
- **Profile Builder**: Initially returning `profile.topArtists: undefined` ❌
- **Artist Extraction**: Looking for wrong property name in profile object ❌

**Key Issue**: Code was accessing `profile.topArtists` but the actual profile structure uses `profile.artists`.

### **Debugging Steps Taken**

#### **Step 1: Error Identification**
```javascript
// Initial error discovered
ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'userId' before initialization
```
- **Action**: Fixed variable declaration order in `generateArtistRecommendations()`

#### **Step 2: Graph Algorithm Analysis**
```javascript
// Graph algorithm failing as expected
POST /rest/v1/rpc/graph_artist_recommendations [HTTP/3 404]
// Error: Could not find function graph_artist_recommendations
```
- **Action**: Confirmed fallback to JavaScript implementation working
- **Temporary Fix**: Disabled graph algorithm by default (`useGraphAlgorithm = false`)

#### **Step 3: Data Flow Debugging**
```javascript
// Debug output showing the core issue
🔧 Debug: Albums count: 8, User ID: null, Graph enabled: false
📊 Debug: All artists from albums: ["Uriah Heep", "The Parlor Mob", "The Beatles", ...]
📊 Debug: Profile topArtists: undefined  // ← The problem
```

#### **Step 4: Profile Structure Investigation**
- **Discovered**: `CollectionProfiler.buildUserProfile()` creates `profile.artists`, not `profile.topArtists`
- **Root Cause**: Artist recommendation code using incorrect property name

#### **Step 5: Code Correction**
```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
const artistNames = profile.topArtists?.map(a => a.artist) || [];

// After (correct)
const artistNames = profile.artists?.map(a => a.artist || a.name || a) || [];
```

#### **Step 6: Data Validation**
```javascript
// Expected debug output after fix
📊 User profile built with 8 artists
📊 Artist names to fetch: ["Uriah Heep", "The Parlor Mob", "The Beatles"]
🎵 Last.fm API calls for artist.getsimilar
📊 Built recommendations: X artists
```

### **Resolution Status**
- ✅ **Graph Algorithm**: Graceful fallback implemented
- ✅ **Basic Algorithm**: Profile extraction fixed
- ✅ **Data Flow**: Proper artist name extraction
- ✅ **Testing**: Artist recommendations now appearing correctly on localhost
- ✅ **Debugging Session**: Successfully completed with working solution

### **Production Deployment Requirements**
To achieve full functionality in production:
1. **Deploy PostgreSQL Function**: Run `graph_recommendation_function.sql` migration
2. **Update RLS Policies**: Run `fix_global_cache_rls_policies.sql` migration
3. **Verify Cache Permissions**: Ensure authenticated users can write to global caches

This debugging session revealed that the issue was **code logic**, not environment differences, making the fix applicable to both localhost and production environments.

## 🎯 **Metadata Coverage Issue & Progressive Enhancement (September 2024)**

### **Problem: Sparse Metadata Coverage**

**Symptoms Observed:**
- Most artist recommendations show `hasInfo: false`
- Basic algorithm: "4 genres • 17% max genre" (only 4 of 20 have metadata)
- Graph algorithm: "0 genres • -Infinity%" (none have metadata)
- Diversity filtering falls back to name-based approach
- Toggle between diverse/all shows minimal difference

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The metadata fetching strategy has a fundamental mismatch:

1. **Candidate Pool Size**: 8 owned artists × 20 similar artists = **160 potential candidates**
2. **Current Metadata Fetching**: Only fetches for **15 artists** (top 5 per source artist, max 15 total)
3. **Recommendations Generated**: Returns top **20-30 artists** from the 160 candidates
4. **Result**: 160 candidates, 15 have metadata, 20 are displayed → **~25% coverage at best**

**Why Graph Algorithm Has 0% Coverage:**

Graph algorithm completely bypasses the metadata fetching step:
```javascript
// Graph flow (no metadata!)
graphService.generateGraphRecommendations() → return results
// vs
// Basic flow (limited metadata)
fetchSimilarArtists() → fetchMetadataFor15Artists() → score160Artists() → return top 20
```

### **Current Architecture**

**Metadata Fetch Timing (PROBLEM):**
```
1. Fetch similar artists (160 candidates)
2. Fetch metadata for 15 artists ← TOO EARLY, TOO FEW!
3. Score all 160 artists
4. Return top 20 (only 2-4 have metadata)
```

**Why This Doesn't Work:**
- We don't know which 20 artists will be top-ranked until AFTER scoring
- Fetching metadata for 15 random artists is like buying lottery tickets
- The 15 we fetch metadata for might not even make the top 20

### **Solution: Two-Pass Approach with Progressive Enhancement**

**Optimal Flow:**
```
1. Fetch similar artists (160 candidates)
2. Score all 160 artists WITHOUT metadata (fast!)
3. Take top 30 by score
4. Fetch metadata ONLY for those 30 artists
5. Merge metadata into recommendations
6. Apply diversity filtering (now has real data)
7. Return top 20 with 100% metadata coverage
```

### **Implementation Plan: Option A + Progressive Enhancement**

#### **Phase 1: Immediate Load (0-2 seconds)**
Show recommendations instantly with scoring, no metadata:

```javascript
// 1. Score artists (fast, no API calls)
const scoredArtists = await scoreAllCandidates(candidatePool);

// 2. Show top 20 immediately
setRecommendations({
  artists: scoredArtists.slice(0, 20),
  metadata: {
    status: 'loading-metadata',
    coverage: '0%'
  }
});

// 3. User sees recommendations right away (no 30 second wait!)
```

**User Experience:**
- Recommendations appear instantly
- Message: "⚡ Loading genre data..."
- Diversity toggle disabled initially

#### **Phase 2: Targeted Metadata Fetch (2-32 seconds)**
Fetch metadata only for top 30 candidates:

```javascript
// 4. Extract top 30 for metadata
const topCandidates = scoredArtists.slice(0, 30);
const artistsToFetch = topCandidates.map(a => ({
  name: a.artist,
  mbid: a.mbid
}));

// 5. Fetch metadata (30 API calls × 1 second = 30 seconds)
const artistMetadata = await fetchMetadataForArtists(artistsToFetch);

// 6. Update recommendations with metadata
setRecommendations(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  artists: mergeMetadata(prev.artists, artistMetadata),
  metadata: {
    status: 'complete',
    coverage: '100%'
  }
}));
```

**User Experience:**
- Progress indicator shows: "Loading genre data... 10/30"
- Recommendations stay visible while metadata loads
- Diversity toggle enables when metadata is ready
- Stats update: "✅ 15 genres represented"

#### **Phase 3: Background Cache Warming (Ongoing)**
Pre-fetch remaining candidates in background:

```javascript
// 7. After showing top 20, warm cache for rest
async function warmCacheInBackground() {
  const remaining = scoredArtists.slice(30, 160); // Next 130 artists

  for (const artist of remaining) {
    // Check cache first
    if (await hasMetadataInCache(artist.name)) continue;

    // Fetch with low priority (doesn't block UI)
    await fetchMetadata(artist, { priority: 'low' });

    // Yield to browser between calls
    await yieldToMainThread();
  }

  console.log('✅ Full metadata cache warmed (160 artists)');
}

// Run in background, non-blocking
setTimeout(() => warmCacheInBackground(), 5000);
```

**Benefits:**
- Next time user generates recommendations, most will be cached
- Progressive improvement over time
- No impact on current session

### **New Service Method: `fetchMetadataForArtists()`**

**Location:** `src/services/recommendationDataFetcher.js`

```javascript
/**
 * Fetch metadata for a specific list of artists
 * More efficient than fetchArtistInfoForSimilarArtists which uses arbitrary limits
 * @param {Array} artists - [{name: "Artist", mbid: "abc123"}, ...]
 * @param {Object} options - {maxConcurrent: 5, priority: 'high'}
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Map of artistName -> artistInfo
 */
async fetchMetadataForArtists(artists, options = {}) {
  const {
    maxConcurrent = 30,
    priority = 'high',
    onProgress = null
  } = options;

  const results = {};
  let processed = 0;

  for (const artist of artists.slice(0, maxConcurrent)) {
    // Check persistent cache first
    const cached = await this.cacheService?.getArtistMetadataCache(artist.name);
    if (cached) {
      results[artist.name] = cached.metadata;
      processed++;
      if (onProgress) onProgress(processed, artists.length);
      continue;
    }

    // Fetch from Last.fm using MBID if available
    await this.delay(this.options.requestDelayMs);
    const response = await this.lastfm.getArtistInfo(
      artist.name,
      'en',
      artist.mbid
    );

    if (response?.artist) {
      results[artist.name] = {
        tags: response.artist.tags?.tag || [],
        playcount: response.artist.stats?.playcount || 0,
        listeners: response.artist.stats?.listeners || 0,
        mbid: response.artist.mbid
      };

      // Cache for future use
      await this.cacheService?.setArtistMetadataCache(
        artist.name,
        response.artist.mbid,
        results[artist.name],
        'lastfm'
      );
    }

    processed++;
    if (onProgress) onProgress(processed, artists.length);
  }

  return results;
}
```

### **Expected Outcomes**

**Before Fix:**
- Initial load: 30 seconds
- Metadata coverage: 25% (5 of 20 artists)
- Diversity stats: "4 genres • 17% max"
- User experience: Long wait, poor diversity filtering

**After Fix:**
- Initial load: 2 seconds (instant recommendations)
- Metadata coverage: 100% (20 of 20 artists after metadata loads)
- Diversity stats: "15+ genres • 20% max"
- User experience: Instant feedback, progressively enhanced

**Performance Metrics:**
- Time to first recommendation: **2 seconds** (vs 30 seconds)
- Time to full metadata: **32 seconds** (same, but non-blocking)
- API calls per session: **30** (vs 15)
- Metadata coverage: **100%** (vs 25%)

### **Progressive Enhancement UX**

```
[0-2s] 🎵 Check These Artists Out (20 suggestions)
       [Artist cards appear with scores]
       ⚡ Loading genre data... (progress bar)

[2-32s] [Metadata progressively updates each card]
        Progress: Loading genre data... 15/30

[32s+]  ✅ Genre data complete
        🎯 Diversity: 15 genres • Max genre: 20% • Score: 0.68
        [Diversity toggle enabled]
```

   - ✅ Detect when user is idle (30s no activity)
   - ✅ Continue fetching metadata for remaining candidates
   - ✅ Pause when user becomes active
   - ✅ localStorage persistence across sessions
