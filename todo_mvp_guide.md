## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### High-Risk Items
1. **API Rate Limits**: Implement proper queuing and fallback strategies
2. **Image Recognition Accuracy**: Multiple identification methods and manual override
3. **PWA Installation Issues**: Thorough testing across browser/device combinations
4. **Performance on Mobile**: Optimize early and test frequently

### Fallback Plans
- **If Google API becomes unavailable**: Switch to Bing/Yandex alternatives
- **If identification accuracy is low**: Emphasize manual entry assistance features
- **If audio fingerprinting proves complex**: Focus on image-based identification only
- **If PWA adoption is problematic**: Ensure excellent mobile web experience
