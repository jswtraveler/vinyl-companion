# Next Session Brief: Fix Album Cover Images in Mood Suggestions

## üéØ Session Goals
Fix missing album cover images in the mood suggestion filter results and commit changes to the codebase.

## üöÄ Current Status

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed
1. **Mood Filtering Functionality**: Successfully fixed mood suggestion filters
   - **Root Issue**: Case sensitivity mismatch between AI-generated moods (`["Nostalgic", "Upbeat", "Dreamy"]`) and filter IDs (`["nostalgic", "upbeat", "dreamy"]`)
   - **Solution**: Added case normalization in `getMoodsForAlbum()` function
   - **Files Modified**: `src/utils/moodUtils.js`

2. **Enhanced Mood System**: Improved mood matching with fallback support
   - AI-generated moods take priority
   - Genre-based mood mapping as fallback for albums without AI analysis
   - Both systems now work together seamlessly

3. **UI Error Handling**: Added basic error handling for broken images
   - Shows placeholder icon when images fail to load
   - Fixed JSX syntax errors in SuggestionCard component

### ‚ùå Current Issue: Album Cover Images Not Loading

**Problem**: Album cover URLs are truncated to ~175 characters, causing images to fail loading in mood suggestion results.

**Evidence**:
- Original URL: `https://i.discogs.com/gxBF76jI5Ru-gLcN0N9hX_kKuaAl...` (truncated)
- Full URLs should be much longer (~300+ characters)
- Images work in main album grid but not in mood suggestions

**Debugging Done**:
- ‚úÖ Confirmed mood filtering works correctly
- ‚úÖ Verified album data passes through filtering unchanged
- ‚úÖ Identified URL truncation happens in data storage layer, not filtering code
- ‚úÖ Added console debugging (now cleaned up)

## üéØ Next Session Tasks

### 1. Investigate Root Cause of URL Truncation
- **Check database schemas**:
  - Local IndexedDB field limits
  - Supabase `cover_image_url` field constraints
- **Examine data import/save processes**:
  - `src/services/database.js` - local storage
  - `src/services/supabaseDatabase.js` - cloud storage
  - Album form saving logic
- **Test with new album entry**: Add test album with long URL to isolate issue

### 2. Fix URL Storage Issues
- **If database constraint**: Update schema to allow longer URLs
- **If application logic**: Fix truncation in save/import processes
- **If data corruption**: Implement data migration for existing albums

### 3. Improve User Experience
- **Better error handling**: More informative fallbacks for broken images
- **Progressive loading**: Show loading state while images load
- **Image optimization**: Consider resizing/caching for better performance

### 4. Code Organization & Commits
Create multiple focused commits:
1. **"Fix mood filtering case sensitivity issue"**
   - Changes to `src/utils/moodUtils.js`
2. **"Add genre-based mood fallback system"**
   - Enhanced mood matching logic
3. **"Fix album cover URL truncation in [storage layer]"**
   - Database schema or application logic fixes
4. **"Improve image error handling in suggestion cards"**
   - UI improvements and fallbacks

### 5. Testing & Validation
- **Functional Testing**:
  - Mood filters show correct albums
  - Album covers load properly
  - Fallbacks work for missing images
- **Data Testing**:
  - New albums save with full-length URLs
  - Existing albums can be migrated/fixed

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes

### Files Recently Modified
- `src/utils/moodUtils.js`: Fixed case sensitivity, added genre fallback
- `src/components/SuggestionsSection.jsx`: Fixed JSX syntax, basic error handling

### Key Functions
- `getMoodsForAlbum()`: Now normalizes AI mood case and includes genre fallback
- `filterAlbumsByMood()`: Works with both AI and genre-based moods
- `SuggestionCard`: Renders mood-filtered albums

### Environment
- **Development Server**: Run with `npm run dev`
- **Database**: Currently using local IndexedDB (user not authenticated)
- **Test Data**: ~3 albums with AI-generated moods available

## üö® Important Notes
- **Do not commit `next_session_brief.md`** to git repository
- Focus on **fixing the root cause** of URL truncation, not just symptoms
- Maintain **backward compatibility** with existing album data
- Test both **local and cloud database** scenarios

## üìã Success Criteria
1. ‚úÖ Mood suggestion filters show albums with proper cover images
2. ‚úÖ URL truncation issue resolved at source
3. ‚úÖ All changes committed in logical, focused commits
4. ‚úÖ No regressions in existing mood filtering functionality
5. ‚úÖ Robust error handling for edge cases
