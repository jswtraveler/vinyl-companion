### 🔄 Current Issue - AI Analysis 404 Error
**Google Gemini API Request Failed**: 
- AI Analysis feature returns 404 error when used
- Likely causes:
  1. **API Key Configuration**: Environment variable not properly loaded in production
  2. **API Endpoint URL**: Incorrect Gemini API URL or version
  3. **Request Format**: Invalid request body or headers
  4. **CORS Issues**: Cross-origin restrictions in production environment
  5. **Network/Netlify**: Build-time vs runtime environment variable issues

### 🎯 Next Session Priority (IMMEDIATE)

**CRITICAL FIX: Identify and Fix 404 Gemini API Request Failed**

**Investigation Plan:**
1. **Environment Variable Check**: Verify `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` is properly set in Netlify
2. **API Endpoint Validation**: Test Gemini API endpoint URL and format
3. **Network Request Debugging**: Add console logging for API calls
4. **Request Format Review**: Verify request body matches Google Gemini API specs
5. **CORS Headers**: Check if additional headers needed for production
6. **API Key Validation**: Test API key directly in browser/Postman
7. **Fallback Testing**: Ensure mock mode works when API fails

**Current Status**: 
- App core functionality 100% operational
- AI feature implemented but blocked by 404 API error
- All other features working perfectly including mobile optimization
