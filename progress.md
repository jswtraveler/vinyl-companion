## ðŸš€ Current Status Summary (End of Day 24)

### âœ… What's Working Perfectly
- **Complete MVP Core Features**: Add, edit, delete, search, sort, statistics
- **Professional PWA**: Installable, offline-capable, service worker caching
- **Mobile Camera Integration**: Photo capture, preview, retake functionality  
- **Manual Album Entry**: Both camera buttons work, form opens with captured image
- **Development Environment**: Hot-reloading, testing, production builds
- **API Infrastructure**: SerpAPI client, MusicBrainz, Discogs, OCR - all coded and ready

### ðŸ”„ Current Blocker
**Mobile SerpAPI Network Issue**: 
- Identification fails at Step 2 (SerpAPI network call)
- Takes very long time to even reach Step 2 (network latency)
- Desktop testing confirmed APIs work correctly
- Issue is mobile-specific network/CORS/browser limitation

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Session Priority (Start Here Tomorrow)

**IMMEDIATE FOCUS: Fix Mobile SerpAPI Network Issue**

**Root Cause Analysis Needed:**
1. **CORS Policy**: SerpAPI may block mobile browser requests
2. **Network Timeout**: Mobile network slower than desktop  
3. **HTTPS Requirement**: Mixed content issues on mobile
4. **Mobile Browser Limitations**: Chrome mobile API restrictions

**Investigation Plan:**
1. **Test SerpAPI directly in mobile browser** (bypass app)
2. **Check CORS headers** in mobile dev tools alternative
3. **Test over cellular vs WiFi** 
4. **Compare desktop vs mobile network behavior**
5. **Implement request logging** for mobile debugging

**Fallback Solutions Ready:**
- OCR-only identification working
- Manual entry with photo working  
- All core functionality operational

The app is 95% complete - just need to resolve this mobile network issue for SerpAPI identification.
